## Hack my city
Designed to increase youth engagement with City Planning, the intent of Hack my City is to let users see each building within Adelaide, modify the building and save the new model to their profile. Using the Hack My City web interface, it's possible to recolour and resize Adelaide's buildings according to your creative whim! Users can also print 3D models from Hack My City. Along with these features, accompanying factual information and historic photographs provide the user with an historical understanding of our city.
